## How Consistent is Kansas Precipitation?

This project was for a cartography class where I got to experiment with different design techniques. 

The precipitation data is from the Kansas Office of the State Climatologist (K State Weather Data Library). This provided annual precipitation data for Kansas counties from 2014 - 2024. I pulled all the data into one Excel file, calculated the mean and standard deviation of rainfall per county, and then derived the coefficient of variation (CV) from it.  <br>

I used an SQL query to only label cities with a population greater than 126,000 and I removed the city of “Overland Park” because it was competing for space between the “Kansas City” and “Olathe” label. After this, western Kansas had almost no city labels, so I added “Hays” and “Dodge City” because those are two cities that are decently populated. Later in the design process, I added “Liberal” in Seward County because I made a callout for Seward (as the county with the most variation), and I thought it would be helpful to show a populated city there.
